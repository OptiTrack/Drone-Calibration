# License Information

This project uses the **[Qt](https://www.qt.io/)** framework under open source licenses.

## Qt Licensing

Qt is being used under the following open source license:

### [GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html)

This is the more permissive license and allows dynamic linking without requiring your entire codebase to be open source.

Key points:
- You may dynamically link against Qt without releasing your source code.
- If you modify Qt itself, those changes must be open source under LGPL.
- You must still provide attribution and preserve license notices.

## Licensing Notes

By using the Qt framework in this project, you agree to comply with the license terms above.

If you require a more permissive license or wish to statically link Qt in proprietary software, please consider obtaining a **commercial Qt license** from **The Qt Company**.
